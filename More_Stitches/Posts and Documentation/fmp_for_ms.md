**Fundamental Analysis** aims to find the enterprise value of the company. It means arriving at its Intrinsic price. This kind of analysis uses Economic factors. These factors prove the fundamental elements to determine the price. So if you are opting for the Fundamental route, be sure to perform the following analysis: **FEEL FREE TO SKIP OVER THE STEPS**

*Steps in Fundamental Analysis*
1. [Industry Analysis](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/industry-analysis-guide/)
	* Sector Growth
	* Contribution to GDP
	* Trends in that sector
	* [Demand and Supply Analysis](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/demand-and-supply-analysis/)
2. Company Analysis
	* [Ratio Analysis](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/ratio-analysis/), Carry out Horizontal and [Vertical Analysis](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/vertical-analysis-formula/)
	* Evaluate Trends over time. Compute the percentage increase or decrease relative to the base year.
	* Understand where the company has applied its resources. Know the proportions in which they are distributed among various accounts (balance sheet and income statement).
	* The next tool that you must adopt is Ratio Analysis. It will help you understand the changes in the company’s Financial Situation.
		* Note that, Ratios are parameters and not absolute measurements. Hence it must be interpreted cautiously.
3. FInancial Modeling
	* Forecast the future Financial of the Company (financial modeling) for the next five to seven years.
	* You may require a lot of information and assumptions here.
	* The ultimate goal is to understand how the [financial statements](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/financial-statements/) and the stock price will look in the future.
4. Valuation Analysis
	* Many Valuation techniques are company/industry dependent. [For example, in most cases, DCF](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/dcf-discounted-cash-flow/), and Relative Valuation approaches (like [PE Multiple](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/pe-ratio/) [Price to book value ratio](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/price-to-book-value-ratio/), [Price to Cash Flow](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/price-to-cash-flow-ratio/), etc.), [SOTP valuation](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/sum-of-the-parts-sotp-valuation/) is used. However, you may require other types of approaches based on company type. 
	* In **Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,** you arrive at an Intrinsic price. The methods and procedures used for the same are interesting. We are not going to discuss the same in detail in this article. But let’s jump to the step where you arrive at your intrinsic Share Price for the company. So here is how you will interpret your results.
		* If Market Price > Intrinsic Share Price= Stock is Overvalued, the recommendation is to sell the stock.
		* If Market Price < Intrinsic Share Price= Stock is Undervalued, Recommendation here will be to Buy the stock
	* **Realtive Valution Analysis.** This valuation technique makes use of comparable Company Analysis. You value your company of interest by comparing it to its peer group. Some of the valuation parameters used in this are:
		* PE ratio
		* EPS
		* EV/EBITDA
		* EV/Sales etc.

OK, so thats alot to get through. As you can see there's a signficant amount of information needed to perform fundamental analysis of a single company.  But what if you're going to evaluate all companies within the sector?  That could take a while.  But let's take this piece by piece.

First off we have **Industry Analysis,** according to [MarketResearch.com](https://www.marketresearch.com/) the sector I'm looking for is a sub section of consumer goods.  And, could fall into one of these sub sectors:
1. Apparel
2. Consumer Goods & Retailing Company Reports
3. Luxury Goods
4. Reatiling

Let's stick will the [Apparel section](https://www.marketresearch.com/Consumer-Goods-c1596/Consumer-Goods-Retailing-c80/Apparel-c612/) for right now
