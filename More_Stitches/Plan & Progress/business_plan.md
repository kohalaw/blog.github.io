## Company Description
MS is a  footwear and apparel sector specific, entertainment forward, media (i.e. news and information) company w/ special emphasis on finance, economics, supply chain. Our products will be both web and video for the purpose of democrotizing information, tools, and research currently reserved for executives of multi-billion companies who can afford the unattainable management consulting fees the go along with access today. 

These c-suite suits are not our audience, although they may be the target of our opionon articles.  Our consuers are everyone else: mid-level corp leaders, retail employees, ceos of smaller private companies, and everyone inbetween.  These individuals will shape our industry and MS wants to equip them with all the information and tools in one place to support the growth of their businesses and careers.

And, we plan to provide this service at no cost to our consumer.  Well beyond the incovneience of seeing ad's.  Maybe eventually we have paid ad free version  but all the content should be the same regardless of version our consumers
